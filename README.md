## Pokeflare evolution

_welcome to pokeflare evolution github :tada:!_

PokéFlare is more than just a fan game—it's an homage to the Pokémon series while adding unique elements that make it stand out. Whether you’re a seasoned Pokémon master or new to the franchise, PokéFlare invites you to dive into a new adventure that promises to keep you hooked.

Getting Started:
You can download PokéFlare directly from our GitHub repository. The game is free to play and open source, so feel free to explore, contribute, or modify the game to suit your preferences.

Contributing:
We welcome contributions! If you have a knack for game development, art, music, or even just love Pokémon, consider checking out our project on GitHub. You can report bugs, suggest features, or dive into the code to help make PokéFlare even better.

### :keyboard: Activity: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
1. Under your repository name, click **Settings**.
1. Click **Pages** in the **Code and automation** section.
1. Ensure "Deploy from a branch" is selected from the **Source** drop-down menu, and then select `main` from the **Branch** drop-down menu.
1. Click the **Save** button.
1. Wait about _one minute_ then refresh this page (the one you're following instructions from). [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update to the next step.
   > Turning on GitHub Pages creates a deployment of your repository. GitHub Actions may take up to a minute to respond while waiting for the deployment. Future steps will be about 20 seconds; this step is slower.
   > **Note**: In the **Pages** of **Settings**, the **Visit site** button will appear at the top. Click the button to see your GitHub Pages site.
